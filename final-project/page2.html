                One of the first things you have to do when making a minecraft world is: choose the type of game mode
                you would like to play in. At a first glance, it may seem like you only have 5 options. Peaceful, Easy,
                Normal, Hard, Hardcore, and Creative. Although, in reality there's almost an endless array of possible
                game modes to choose from. This mainly comes from the world's preset customization. Make your world
                interesting and captivating. Not simply because of your builds but what makes the generation
                interesting. Make a world entirely superflat, or a world with no structures, or both. Make the world
                more or less than what the game offers directly. You wanna quit because you died and lost all your
                items. Put on keeping inventory, it's your world not the world. That is what makes minecraft beloved,
                it's moldable in all aspects. You could make a normal world and that's still deeply encouraged.
                Although, having a world that brings a new challenge/abnormality, is always invergating. Customize the
                world, to further those creative desires. Make a world that inspires you.

            <p id="mentality_phara">Now that you have a World, what kinda mentality should we have when approaching it?
                The best way to approach a world is to not play the game like it's an RPG. Many players, when they first
                join a world, want to instantly get the best tools and items. This “rushing to beat the game as fast as
                possible”, creates this sense of urgency and time limit. It is heavily toxic and one of the main reasons
                players quit after a week. It creates a mentality that insists the game has a time limit. That the
                player needs to work faster so they can get to the next thing. This game is not your 9-5. Take time to
                enjoy the context around you. Play the game slowly, not like you're trying to get a world record.
                Ultimately, do the things that entice you. By rushing to get to the end, many players skip over large
                portions/content of the game. Minecraft is NOT an RPG. It's a sandbox game that offers a plethora of
                ways to do one thing. Instead of doing it in the fastest possible way. Do it in the most interesting
                way, you don't have any deadlines. Have fun, it's a video game, it's supposed to be something fulfilling
                not demmanding.

                Now if you are really bored or just want to do something absurd. Try to complete some of the
                achievements in the achievements bar. Found in the options section. If you're new to Minecraft it also
                offers a more linear progression. I personally don't recommend this tab. However, the other tabs like
                Adventure, Husbandry, Nether, and even The End tab are great places to look to find inspiration for odd
                goals to achieve. Give a few a try.
